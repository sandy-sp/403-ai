# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Blog System with Admin Dashboard is the core content management feature of 403 AI - Forbidden AI. This feature enables administrators to create, edit, and publish rich-text blog posts about AI research, discussions, and news through an intuitive Blogger-style dashboard. The system provides a complete blogging solution with a powerful rich text editor, media management, categorization, tagging, and public-facing blog pages optimized for SEO and performance.

The admin dashboard will mimic the familiar Google Blogger interface, making it easy for content creators to publish high-quality AI content quickly. The public blog pages will showcase this content in a modern, dark-themed, cyberpunk aesthetic that aligns with the "Forbidden AI" brand.
