## üéØ Option 2: Resend with Domain Verification (Recommended for Production)

**Best for:** Production use with custom domain

### Setup (30 minutes + 24-48 hours DNS propagation)

2. **Add Domain in Resend**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter: `403-ai.com`

3. **Get DNS Records**
   Resend will show you DNS records to add. Example:
   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: _resend
   Value: resend-verify=abc123...
   
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Value: mx.resend.com
   Priority: 10
   ```

4. **Add DNS Records in Squarespace**
   - Login to Squarespace
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí 403-ai.com
   - Click "DNS Settings"
   - Add each record shown by Resend
   - Save

5. **Wait for Verification**
   - DNS propagation: 5 minutes - 48 hours (usually ~2 hours)
   - Check status in Resend dashboard
   - You'll see "Verified" when ready

6. **Update Environment Variable**
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_api_key_here
   EMAIL_FROM=noreply@403-ai.com
   ```

7. **Redeploy**
   - In Vercel, update `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable
   - Redeploy your site

### How It Works

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Q: Can I deploy without email at all?

**A:** Yes! Email is only needed for:
- Password reset (users can still sign in if they remember password)
- Newsletter (future feature, not implemented yet)
- Comments (future feature, not implemented yet)

You could deploy without email service and add it later. Just leave `RESEND_API_KEY` empty.

### Q: Will password reset work with sandbox mode?

**A:** Yes! As long as you add your email as verified in Resend dashboard, you can test password reset.

### Q: How much does Resend cost?

**A:** Free tier: 3,000 emails/month, 100 emails/day. More than enough for a blog!

### Q: Can I change email service later?

**A:** Yes! You can switch between options anytime by updating environment variables and redeploying.

### Q: Do I need to set up email forwarding in Squarespace?

**A:** No, not required. Resend handles sending emails. Forwarding is only if you want to receive replies.
